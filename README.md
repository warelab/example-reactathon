Simple React App — Gramene Hackathon
====================================

Getting started
---------------

0. Get this code. Find the link in github.

1. Install dependencies specified in `package.json`:
   `npm install`

2. Install command-line "global" tools
   `npm install -g browserify watchify uglify-js live-server`

3. To develop live, run these commands in separate terminal windows:
   `npm run watch` <— this command builds the source in development mode. It also listens for any changes you make and recompiles.
   `live-server` <— this command runs a dev web server that watches for file changes, and will open your default browser.
